## About TensorFlow

TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. With TensorFlow 2.0, tf.keras is the preferred high-level API for TensorFlow, to make model building easier and more intuitive. You may use the tf.keras built-in compile()/fit() methods, or write your own custom training loops. See the Effective TensorFlow 2.0 guide and the tf.keras guide for more details.
TensorFlow 2.0 was recently released and this competition is to challenge Kagglers to use TensorFlow 2.0’s APIs focused on usability, and easier, more intuitive development, to make advancements on Question Answering.

## Getting Started

Here are some resources to help you get started:

* Starter notebook using BERT on the dataset. Note: This baseline uses code that was migrated from TF1.x. Be aware that it contains use of tf.compat.v1, which is not permitted to be eligible for TF2.0 prizes in this competition. It is intended to be used as a starting point, but we're excited to see how much better you can using TF2.0!
* Some additional TensorFlow 2.0 resources:
  ** Effective TensorFlow 2.0 Guide
  ** Migrating code from TF1.x to TF2.0 as well as an upgrade script
  ** tf.keras Guide
  ** Kaggle's announcement about TF2.0 released in notebooks
* Information on the TF2.0 prizes you an earn in this competition
* The Natural Questions site for more information about their dataset or to download directly from them. Note that this competition's private test set is completely different from any of the datasets used by Natural Questions.
* Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Credits: For entrants in this competition, we are distributing $300 Coupons for GCP Credit. Requests can be made by submitting this form by November 18, 2019. We'll distribute the coupons by November 25th.
You must have made a submission to this competition, or your request will be rejected.
Only one person per team will be issued a Coupon. This will be verified and multiple requests from the same team will be de-duplicated.
