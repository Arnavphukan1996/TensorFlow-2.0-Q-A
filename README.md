## About TensorFlow

TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. With TensorFlow 2.0, tf.keras is the preferred high-level API for TensorFlow, to make model building easier and more intuitive. You may use the tf.keras built-in compile()/fit() methods, or write your own custom training loops. See the Effective TensorFlow 2.0 guide and the tf.keras guide for more details.
TensorFlow 2.0 was recently released and this competition is to challenge Kagglers to use TensorFlow 2.0’s APIs focused on usability, and easier, more intuitive development, to make advancements on Question Answering.
